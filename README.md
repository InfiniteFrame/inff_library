# inff_library

IMPORTANT This is not quite ready for use. THIS MESSAGE WILL BE REMOVED WHEN ALL FILES HAVE BEEN VERIFIED AND UPLOADED

 after many years of being used on various websites under open source licensing we are once again putting the library and our open source back on GitHub. 

## Recommended use

It is recommended you store this library in a central location on a central server. This is for obvious reasons. Keeping a separate
version of this file with every website would generally prove too unwieldy in anything more than a 1 website environment.

We also believe this is more of a modern practice to point at centrally hosted JavaScript and CSS files when possible.

-- ADD MORE ABOUT this being a best practice HERE

For example: 
 - when using just the inff_lib.js file.
 - central server domain is server.my.com then the URL for the main JavaScript file might look like https://server.my.com/inff/inff_lib.js
 
  * note use of path inff this should be an alias or the like 
  
  Configuration samples coming for APACHE and NGIX.  IIS samples for windows may be added at a later date though it is recommended this
  Library be run on a Linux environment as windows is generally not tested against with this library.

  Based on data found here: https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/web_server/all this priority makes the most sense.
